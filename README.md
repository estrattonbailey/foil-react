# @foil/react
React adapter for [foil](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/foil). 800 bytes.

## Features & Goals
1. Flexible
2. Async
3. Tiny

## Install
```bash
npm i foil @foil/react --save
```

# Usage
`foil` is somewhat unique in that *when* and *what* it renders is up to
the user. The same applies to `@foil/react`.

Instead of immediately rendering navigation events, `@foil/react` calls a user
defined `resolve` function with the matched route and a `rerender` callback that
accepts a React component. Users can then fetch data, load components, or perform
transition animations before calling `rerender` when ready.

## Mounting the Router
On the client, the `Router` component requires the following items:
- `router` - a `foil` router instance
- `context` - an initial context object, usually obtained by resolving the
  starting location using the `foil` router instance
- `resolve` - user defined function, called when a route is matched

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { router, route } from 'foil'
import { Router } from '@foil/react'

const app = router(
  route({
    path: '/',
    payload: {
      Component: () => <h1>Home</h1>
    }
  }),
  route({
    path: '*',
    payload: {
      Component: () => <h1>404</h1>
    }
  })
)

app.resolve(window.location.pathname, ({ payload, context }) => {
  const { Component } = payload

  render((
    <Router
      router={app}
      context={context}
      resolve={({ payload, context }, rerender) => {
        const { Component } = payload
        rerender(Component)
      }}>
      <Component />
    </Router>
  ), document.body)
})
```

## Navigating
`@foil/react` includes a `Link` component to allow for easy naviation throughout
your app.
```javascript
import { Link } from '@foil/react'

export default props => (
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><Link href='/'>Home</Link></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
)
```

## Accessing Router Internals
For cases where you need to reference router properties, you can use the
`withRouter` higher order component. It provides its child with the following
properties on the `router` prop:
- `params` - `object` - any matched parameters from the route path
- `location` - `string` - the full matched location
- `push` - `function` - navigate to new location i.e. for redirects

```javascript
import { withRouter } from '@foil/react'

export default withRouter(props => (
  <button onClick={e => {
    props.router.push('/')
  }>Go to Home</button>
))
```
In other cases where a higher order component is cumbersome, you can also use
the `history` manager directly.
```javascript
import { history } from '@foil/react'

export default props => (
  <button onClick={e => {
    history.push('/')
  }>Go to Home</button>
)
```

# Server Side Rendering
On the server, usage is essentially the same as on the client. However, since we
don't need to resolve route changes, the `resolver` prop on `Router` is not
required.

```javascript
import express from 'express'
import React from 'react'
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import router from './router.js' // foil router

server.get('*', (req, res) => {
  app.resolve(req.originalUrl, ({ payload, context, redirect }) =>  {
    if (redirect) {
      res.redirect(redirect.to)
    }

    const { Component } = payload

    res.send(`<!doctype html>
      <html>
        <head></head>
        <body>${renderToString(
          <Router router={router} context={context}>
            <Component />
          </Router>
        )}</body>
      </html>
    `)
  })
})
```
